# data_mining
mine_nugget prototype &amp;&amp; puppeteer 
The intention for this javascript app is to:

1) Work from another repo: "Mine Nugget" to create a simple, similar UI.

2) find data and confirm: 
* if it's doable to Use puppeteer to scrape data from leafly.com
* * Text a specified number with the object data. If the text response from the text message indicates a truthy response, build object, if a falsy response, user confirms they are NOT okay with data.
* * * (optionally allow through text message to send back as response data the object that is to be used to add to the API of strain data.

3) Use inner fs facilitated JSON files to update database.

4) GraphQL for routing.

5) react && express instead of Next.js
